--SO this project covered alot of new content. 
    In overview this project contains a statically built site through Nodejs that is processed through the view engin EJS. Built with express, passport, mongoose/mongodb.
    Validation and sanitization of input was performed and crypting passwords with bcrypt was used as well. 
This project took a minute for me to wrap my head around when it came to security and authorization. There is still a issue where the user logs out super fast during the session, Ill be looking into this for the next project when I am making a blog. 
   I rushed through this project, even though it took me more time then I thought it would, so I could get to APIs. I have a few clients I am attempting to build some sites for and I am speeding through the backend development portion of oden so I can begin development.
   With the next bit of work coming up I will probably be quite engaged for a while.
